# # Employee Retention Recommendation

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify TikTok videos into two categories: claims or opinions. The model aims to assist TikTok in efficiently managing user reports by prioritizing videos that are likely to contain claims. This project was done as a Capstone Project for the Google Careers Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certifications

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding, and preparing textual and categorical data for analysis
- **Data Analysis**: Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand patterns in the data.
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest and XGBoost Classifier.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Leveraging GridSearchCV to optimize model performance
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, classification reports, and feature importance

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - xgboost
  - pickle

## Usage
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies.
   
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Employee_Retention_Recommendation.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to analyze the data and generate recommendations.

## Output
The notebook produces:
- Visualizations for data distribution and feature importance
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.
- Recommendations for deploying the champion model
